Ultimatley this will be an for full SDLC acceleration AI assistant to build software solutions. 
You'll need to create a `.env` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY=<api_key>` to use some of these. I you set up LM Studio local then the value doesn't matter

I am documenting my journey in this readme as I learn how to put together Autogen Langchain and LM Studio for my experminents.

1. Created AutoGen Agents based on this comedy experiment first using Open to baseline. Then conversted to us LM Studio

2. Today I found an example of a lanchain chatbot that I can use with lm studio. It implements conversation context storage, and summarization with embeddings.
